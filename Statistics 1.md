Q1. What is Statistics?
-	It is a science of collecting , organising and analysing the data

Q2. Define the different types of statistics and give an example of when each type might be used.

-   2 types:   
            1)Descriptive statistics : Organising and summarising the data

                        Ex: Calculating the  average height of a town

            2)Inferential statistics : Using the sample data to copme to conclusion
                
                        Ex: arriving at the avg height of a country by studying the average height of a town

Q3. What are the different types of data and how do they differ from each other? Provide an example of each type of data.  

- Types of data are:
                1. Quantitative:
                            - they are Numerical in nature
                            2 types:
                                1. Discrete data
                                    it is a whole number
                                        ex: No. of Children
                                2. Continous data
                                    it can be of any value
                                        ex: temperature
                2. Qualitative:
                            - they are categorical in nature
                            2 types:
                                1. Nominal data
                                    there is no specific order to it
                                        ex: Colors, Gender
                                2. Ordinal data
                                    there is a specific order to it
                                        ex: Review rating, grades in exam

Q4. Categorise the following datasets with respect to quantitative and qualitative data types:

-     Quantitative:
        - Height data of a class
        - Number of mangoes exported by a farm

-     Qualitative:
        - Grading in exam
        - Colour of mangoes


Q5. Explain the concept of levels of measurement and give an example of a variable for each level.

-       Each scale builds on the previous, meaning that each scale not only “ticks the same boxes” as the previous scale, but also adds another level of precision.

-       Nominal scale : Categorises and labels the variables
                Gender, colour
        Ordinal scale : Ranks the categories in the order
                Review rating
        Interval Scale : has known or equal intervals but doesnot consider the zeros
                Temperature
        Ratio Scale : Considers intervals and also true zeros
                Weights in kg

Q6. Why is it important to understand the level of measurement when analyzing data? Provide an
example to illustrate your answer.

- the levels of measurement will help in the categorising and analysing the data

    For example:
            In order to analyse the favourite colour of a group: 
            - Nominal level:
                we can choose sample of colours, in that ask ppl for their favourite colour
            - Ordinal Level: 
                Rank it and fine tune a particular colur, 
            - Interval level:
                now trying different shades of same colour fine tuning it 
            - Ratio level:
                Measuring the amount of a specific color pigment in a color using a quantitative scale.
                
        Ultimately coming to a exact favourite colour choosen by the people

Q7. How nominal data type is different from ordinal data type.
-   Nominal Data type follows a specific order. Whereas Ordinal data type doesnot follow a specifc order

Q8. Which type of plot can be used to display data in terms of range?

- A type of plot commonly used to display data in terms of range is a box plot

Q9. Describe the difference between descriptive and inferential statistics. Give an example of each type of statistics and explain how they are used.

 1)Descriptive statistics : Organising and summarising the data

                        Ex: Calculating the  average height of a town

 2)Inferential statistics : Using the sample data to copme to conclusion
                
                        Ex: arriving at the avg height of a country by studying the average height of a town

Q10. What are some common measures of central tendency and variability used in statistics? Explain how each measure can be used to describe a dataset.

Measures of Central Tendency:
- Mean : Represents the average value of a dataset. It's sensitive to extreme values and is suitable for normally distributed data.

- Median : Less sensitive to extreme values, making it a robust measure. Suitable for skewed distributions.

- Mode :  Identifies the most common value(s) in a dataset. Applicable to both numerical and categorical data.

Measures of Variability:
- Range:  Provides a simple measure of the spread of data. However, it is sensitive to outliers.

- Variance: Measures the average deviation of each data point from the mean. It gives more weight to extreme values.

- Standard Deviation: Provides a measure of the average distance between each data point and the mean. It's widely used due to its compatibility with the original units of the data.

- Interquartile Range (IQR):Describes the range containing the middle 50% of the data. It is less sensitive to extreme values than the range.
